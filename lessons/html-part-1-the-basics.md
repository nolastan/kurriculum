    note: What is HTML? A programming language? No, not a programming language‚Äîa
      markup language. Hypertext Markup Language. Markup, because we use tags to
      mark up the content of a document. This is a heading, that's a paragraph,
      and so on. HTML tells the web browser about your document's structure.

# Intro

Let's take a dive into HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). HTML is the markup language that provides us a structured way to create web pages. When we use the tags available to us through HTML we can control how almost everything is presented to the user via their web browser. Your web browser is what interprets the tags to present what the end user sees.

## HTML and its Tags

HTML is a markup language interpreted by the browser. It uses specific tags or elements to tell the browser how things should look when presented visually to the user. Lets take a look at some concepts behind how these tags work before we dive into actual tags.

***Not all tags in these examples are real HTML tags. They are being used to explain the concepts.***

Tags are surrounded by angle brackets. Notice the closing tag has the `/` character. This lets the browser know that this is the matching closing tag. Tags are almost always followed up with matching closing tags.


      <tag>some content</tag>

Tags can also be nested inside each other.

    <pizza>
        <topping>pineapple</topping>
        <topping>ham</topping>
        <topping>cheese</topping>
    </pizza>

Tags use something called attributes to add additional functionality or describe behavior.

A side note on HTML attributes: some attributes related to styling have been deprecated over time. It's best practices to do styling through CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Some common attributes like border and align are examples of attributes that have been deprecated to enforce best practices of controlling this with CSS.


      <tag attribute="value">some content</tag>

Some tags are self closing. These tags are usually not intended to wrap content. The `<img>` tag is a common self closing tag. As you can see there is still a `/` at the end of the tag. Notice the use of attributes as well.

    
      <img src="path/to/image/file.jpg" alt="image description" />
# Basic HTML page structure

In this section we will take a look at the structure of an html file. We will discuss the basic tags needed to have a well formed page for display on the web. From this point on we will be speaking in context of HTML5.


## HTML basic example
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
        <title></title>
      </head>
      <body>
      </body>
      </html>

**Lets take a look at some of these tags/elements**

üí° To learn about any HTML tag, enter `mdn.io/``**tag**` in your browser‚Äôs URL bar. Replace *tag* with what tag you interested in. For example: [mdn.io/img](http://mdn.io/img) or [mdn.io/title](http://mdn.io/title).


## Doctype
    `<!DOCTYPE html>` informs the browser which version of HTML will be used in this document. In this case we are declaring that we will be using HTML5. Doctype is special in that it‚Äôs not really considered a tag but a declaration. What you really need to understand about this tag/declaration is that it should be present and the first line in your HTML file.


## Html
    `<html>` is the tag that represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element. That being said, notice the matching closing </html> tag on the last line.


## Head
    `<head>` is that tag that contains descriptive information about your page like the page‚Äôs title `<title>`. This is also where you would include things like <meta> and style sheets. We will get into more of that stuff later in the curriculum. Notice the `<title>` tag has a closing tag, `</title>`, just like the `<html>` tag. 


[Recommended Reading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML)


## Title
    `<title>` is the tag that defines the title of the document, shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab. It can only contain text, and any contained tags are ignored. It is followed by the closing `</title>` tag.
## Body 
    `<body>` represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one `<body>` element in an HTML document. This is where the things you want people to see would go. I am going to stop pointing out the closing tags. I think you got it by now.
# Some common tags explained

Let's take some time to cover some of the most common HTML tags you will use when creating web applications. This will be an interactive lesson so we can see the result of using these tags in a browser. We will build a simple travel page for our example.


## Headings
    The HTML `<h1>` ‚Äì `<h6>` tags represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level and `<h6>` is the lowest.


## Paragraphs
    The HTML `<p>` tag represents a paragraph of text.


## Lists
    HTML has the ability to display lists. Lists are typically ordered or unordered. `<ol>` represents an ordered and `<ul>` represents an unordered list. Ordered lists are numbered and unordered lists use some type of bullet. List items are represented by the `<li>` tag in both ordered and unordered lists.
    
## Links
    Links are represented by the anchor tag ( `<a>`). The anchor tag creates a hyperlink. A hyperlink is a link from one page to another location or file, typically activated by clicking on a highlighted word or image on the screen. A hyperlink can take the user to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL. The text or element between the opening and closing `<a>` tag is what becomes the link.
    
    **Basic anatomy of the anchor tag** `**<a>**`
        There several attributes for an `<a>` tag. Let‚Äôs go over a few of the common ones.
        - **href** - The URL or destination hyperlink points to.
        - **target** - Specifies where to display the linked URL. Below are the most common values used.
            - **_self:** Load the URL into the same browser window as the current one. This is the default behavior if the target attribute is not used.
            - **_blank:** Load the URL into a new browser window or tab based on how the users browser is configured.

[*Further Reading on the*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) `[*<a>*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)` [*tag*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)

**Basic anchor examples**

    <!-- external hyperlink opens in a new window -->
    <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">google.com</a>
    
    <!-- external link opens in the same window -->
    <a href="http://www.google.com">google.com</a>
    
    <!-- Email link that opens users default email client -->
    <a href="mailto:user@example.com">Email User</a>
    
    <!-- link to local another file on the same site -->
    <a href="my_html_file.html">go to my_html_file</a>
    
    <!-- links to element on this page with id="page-section" -->
    <a href="#page-section">Link to page section</a>
    
    <!-- External link that opens in a new window/tab using an image instead of text -->
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">
      <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/6851/mdn_logo.png"/>
    </a>


## Divs

The HTML `<div>` element is a generic container for content flow. We are not going to use this in our travel site but you will see it as we go through the curriculum. It is mainly used to group elements for styling and positioning.
The `<div>` is a block-level element. Browsers typically display the block-level element with a newline both before and after the element.
[Further reading on block-level elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements)

An example of a basic `<div>`:

        1. <div>
        2.   <p>Any kind of content here. Such as
        3.   <p> or <table> tags. You name it!</p>
        4. </div>


## Spans

The HTML `<span>` element is a generic container for content flow. similar to the `<div>`, we are not going to use this in our travel site but you will see it as we go through the curriculum. It is mainly used for styling purposes.

The `<span>` is an inline element. An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element. Basically that means you can wrap it around a word or something similar and it wont add new lines above and below the span. [Further reading on inline tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements)

An example of a `<span>` element:

        1.   <p>Any kind of <span>content</span> here.</p>
