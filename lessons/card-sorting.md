During the *Wireframing* section, you likely created some initial iterations of your app‚Äôs navigation. In the next lesson, we‚Äôll focus purely on navigation. Now, we‚Äôll step out of our wireframes for a moment to explore two research techniques: *Card Sorting* and *Tree Testing.* 

# What is Card Sorting?
To get started, read [**4 Research Techniques for Website Redesigns**](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/research-techniques-for-website-redesigns/). For a more in-depth explanation and some practical tips, read Optimal Workshop‚Äôs [](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/card-sorting)[**Card Sorting 101**](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/card-sorting).

These techniques will provide you with research artifacts that will inform your navigation structure.

Oh, and whatever you came up with for navigation during *Wireframing*? Be ready to throw that away. A designer‚Äôs first solution is rarely the best solution! And even if it is, you‚Äôll only know it‚Äôs the best after exploring all other possible approaches.

# üë§ Practice

This exercise is based on Fiorella Rizza‚Äôs article [How I taught Information Architecture to aspiring UX Designers](https://uxdesign.cc/how-i-taught-information-architecture-to-aspiring-ux-designers-281ce61de42f).


1. Start by duplicating [this list of cities](https://whimsical.com/XBqWS16BhxNSXxQ8y9fbjU#7YNFXnKbYf5A4mKsXtJTN) in Whimsical. 
2. Individually, using cards and stacks, perform an **open** card sorting exercise, creating categories (stacks). Once finished, üì• save a screenshot (or export) of your results.

*Use ‚ÄúStacks‚Äù in Whimsical Sticky Notes to create a group.*


3. Remove the cards from the stacks and shuffle
4. Find someone outside of your cohort to perform a card sort with.
5. Using the categories you created, perform a **closed** card sorting exercise. Once finished, üì• save a screenshot (or export) of your results.

How did the results of the open and closed card sort differ? How do the results compare to your expectations?
